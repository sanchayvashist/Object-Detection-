### Problem Statement 

* The objective of the task is to count the number of small, medium and large pipes from the given video footage.
* The given footage is taken from a camera mounted on top of a mobile base. The mobile base is travelling across a warehouse inside a simulation world. There are several pipes of various sizes(small, medium and large) kept inside the warehouse.
* There will be a penalty for each uncounted pipe.
* This task is based on a real-world application of computer vision in robotics, where robots are used in environments like warehouses for surveillience and management of goods.
* To achieve this task, you are supposed to devise a method to count the pipes belonging to various sizes.

### Solution
1. Extracted frames from given footage using ffmpeg to use as training set object detection model
2.
